'''
Virtual Environment is creating a copy of python
suppose we'd like to use a module named flask with 2 different versions 0.5 and 1.5
suppose we need to deal only with the 1.5 version
so we make a virtual environment and proceed


if errors occurs while using scripts
use:

 Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force;


To activate virtual environment:
 Then use this:
  .\myprojectenv\Scripts\activate.ps1




  #To get out of the virtual environment use the word ----->   'deactivate'

    USE 
    pip freeze
    this gives all the packages and their versions




  pip freeze > file1.txt
  space between freeze and file1 is necessary 

  #the content in pip freeze is copied int file named file1




  pip list can also be used for the same output
  gives better output
